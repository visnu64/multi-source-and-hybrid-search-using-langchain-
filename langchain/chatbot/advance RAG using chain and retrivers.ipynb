Instead of treating every element of the sequence equally, the mechanism assigns a “weight” to each element, indicating how much it should influence the current computation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 2. Step‑by‑step Breakdown Using the Transformer Context\\n\\n| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |\\n|------|--------------|----------------|\\n| **1. Input → Linear Transformations** | For each token in a sequence, the model learns three *vectors*: a **query** \\\\(q\\\\), a **key** \\\\(k\\\\), and a **value** \\\\(v\\\\) (via learned weight matrices). | These are the ingredients into which attention can be expressed mathematically. |\\n| **2. Compute Similarity (Dot Product)** | The similarity between the query of a target position and the keys of *all* positions is calculated as a dot product: \\\\(q_i \\\\cdot k_j\\\\). | This step tells how “related” or “relevant” each other position is to the current one. |\\n| **3. Scale and Softmax** | The dot products are divided by \\\\(\\\\sqrt{d_k}\\\\) (to keep gradients stable) and then passed through a softmax to get a probability distribution over all positions: \\\\(\\\\alpha_{ij} = \\\\text{softmax}(q_i \\\\cdot k_j / \\\\sqrt{d_k})\\\\). | The softmax turns raw scores into *attention weights* that sum to 1, effectively turning a set of similarities into a set of “attention proportions.” |\\n| **4. Weighted Sum over Values** | For each target token, the final representation is a weighted sum of all *values*: \\\\(\\\\sum_j \\\\alpha_{ij} v_j\\\\). | This is the essence of attention: the representation is a mixture of all other tokens, weighted by how relevant each token is. |\\n| **5. Multi‑Head Extension (Optional)** | The paper repeats the above process *h* times in parallel (with different learned linear projections), producing *h* independent “heads.” The outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed once more. | Multi‑head attention allows the model to capture different “types” of relationships simultaneously (e.g., syntactic vs. semantic). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 3. Why Attention is Useful\\n\\n- **Global Dependencies with Constant Parallelism:**  \\n  As the paper notes, a self‑attention layer connects **all** positions with only a constant number of operations, unlike a recurrent layer that requires \\\\(O(n)\\\\) sequential steps. This means a single attention block can instantly relate distant tokens—critical for language where long‑range dependencies abound.\\n\\n- **No Recurrence / Convolution Needed:**  \\n  Attention subsumes the role traditionally played by recurrent or convolutional layers (which aggregate context locally or sequentially). The Transformer thus becomes *“fully attention‑based”*, allowing for vastly greater parallelization and speed.\\n\\n- **Reparameterization Invariance:**  \\n  By learning queries, keys, and values, the model can decide **which parts of the sequence to attend to on the fly**, adapting to different linguistic phenomena without hard‑coded rules.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 4. Types of Attention Mentioned\\n\\n- **Self‑attention (Intra‑attention):**  \\n  Relates positions within a single sequence (e.g., a sentence) to compute richer representations. Used both in the encoder (for the source sentence) and decoder (for generated tokens).\\n\\n- **Cross‑attention (Inter‑attention):**  \\n  Connects the decoder’s query tokens to the encoder’s key/value tokens. Enables the decoder to “look back” at the source sentence while generating translations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### 5. Bottom Line\\n\\nIn the **Transformer architecture** summarized in the paper:\\n\\n| Role | Component | Mechanism | Purpose |\\n|------|-----------|------------|---------|\\n| **Encode source tokens** | Encoder self‑attention | Each token attends to all others | Capture sentence-wide context |\\n| **Attend during decoding** | Decoder self‑attention | Autoregressive masking ensures only prior tokens are used | Preserve causality | \\n| **Align with input** | Decoder cross‑attention | Queries from decoder, keys/values from encoder | Provide source‑side context for each target token |\\n\\nThe attention mechanism, therefore, is **the core computational primitive** that lets the Transformer compute global dependencies efficiently, replace recurrent and convolutional layers, and achieve state‑of‑the‑art translation quality while remaining highly parallelizable.'"
